My work on languages aims to bring a mixed-methods approach to language endangerment research to better understand how indigenous societies value language and culture and encourage participatory governance. 

I published a qualitative case study on language endangerment in Arunachal Pradesh for which I designed and administered questionnaires to native speakers. [The study](https://sprf.in/language-endangerment-and-culture-loss-tai-khamti/) attempted to link the anthropological concept of "culture loss" to language endangerment. I have since continued my work on language by focusing on language policy - specifically, the need for more participative (or [reflexive](https://econforeverybody.com/2024/01/22/on-greater-reflexivity-in-economics/#:~:text=What%20is%20reflexivity,of%20their%20research.)) policymaking - which I also addressed in an [invited talk](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/purbapath-id_join-us-tomorrow-for-our-conversation-with-activity-7145734183364026368-fekS) with the  Department of ST & SC Development at the Government of Odisha.

I hope to work further on more quantitative understandings of language endangerment and language valuation, in order to assist evidence-based language policymaking.
