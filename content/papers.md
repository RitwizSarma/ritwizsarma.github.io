      The Himalayan Tightrope: A High-resolution Study of Economy-Environmental Tradeoff of Infrastructure Development <br><small> With <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/riju-garg/" target="_blank">Riju Garg</a>.

  </summary>
<small> <small> This paper uses modern high-resolution data on growth and environmental degradation to analyze the trade-offs between economic development and ecological conservation amidst infrastructure development in the northern Himalayan region. We use novel satellite-based data sources to capture highly localized effects of development and attempt to investigate the micro-level tradeoffs currently being made in building infrastructure in sensitive biomes. </small> </small>

      Guns, Gems, and Glory: How Conflict and Mineral Resources Shape Trade Patterns <br><small> With Dillies Justine and Mohamed Asif. [<a href="/files/Paper_TradeConf.pdf">Full paper.</a>] [<a href="/files/refs/Paper_TradeConf.bib">BibTeX cite.</a>] </small>

  </summary>
<small> Analyzing data from 116 countries (2006–2014) using a structural gravity model, we find that conflict reduces overall trade—particularly in mineral-rich countries—while increasing arms imports in the same settings. Natural resources, rather than insulating economies, may finance militarization—highlighting a trade-off with serious policy implications. </small>

  </summary>
<small> Transport infrastructure assumed a strategic priority only next to defense and military expenditure in the Afghan reconstruction project post the collapse of the Taliban regime in 2001. This paper explores the political economy challenges of aid-funded development in fragile settings. We identify poor contracting mechanisms, the nexus among insurgents and middlemen, and weak state capacity as three primary political economy factors causing the collapse of strategic road infrastructure in Afghanistan.</small> </small>

  </summary>
<small> This study attempts to analyse the cultural impact of language loss in Tai Khamti speakers, an endangered language community native to North-Eastern India. Primary data is collected to assess cultural markers relating to linguistic maintenance, indigenous knowledge and documentation, linguistic cultural markers, and narrative forms. The analysis of this data provides insight into culture loss through linguistic endangerment in North-Eastern India and the broader intersection of language and culture. </small> </small>

      Using deep learning to classify court hearings. <br> <small> At <i><a href="https://xkdr.org">xKDR Forum</a>. July 2024</i>.
    </span>
    <span class="dropdown-caret"></span>
  </summary>
<small>A large proportion of hearings in the Indian court system are <a href="https://blog.theleapjournal.org/2023/12/how-substantial-are-non-substantive.html#gsc.tab=0">non-substantive</a>, in that they do not yield progress in the case. In the era of digitized court data, researchers now have access to millions of court orders, the text of which allows them to understand whether a particular hearing was substantive or otherwise. I provide a study of different AI/ML methods for text classification at scale, involving shallow and deep learning methods as well as a cost comparison to LLMs. I find that labelling data has decreasing marginal returns, allowing for deep learning to theoretically be more efficient than LLMs for judicial data.</small>
